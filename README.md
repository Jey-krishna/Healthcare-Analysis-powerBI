# Health Care Analysis
Welcome to the Healthcare Analysis project repository! This project aims to analyze a healthcare dataset using Power BI to uncover insights and trends in patient demographics and healthcare costs.
## Overview
In this project I analyze the healthcare dataset and try to get enough insights based on the data to make better decisions for the patients healthcare. Before that I need  to clean, transform, analyze  the data,
so thatt it could be more easier to draw enough visualizations.
## Overview of the dataset

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Understanding:** Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents
2. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's ready for analysis
3. **Visualization:** Create visualizations that highlight key findings in the data
4. **Report taking:** Interpret the results of analysis and derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making in the healthcare domain
